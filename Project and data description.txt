This was one of my very first projects of my intern as a Data Scientist at Strategic IP Information, Noida.
I can't share the dataset and other files which were used in this prject to perform text mining over, and creating a
wordcloud after text analysis due to company's privacy policy. This wordcloud indicates the very words which were used most frequently and then using those
words, certain entities were extracted out of the data, indicating certain related online risks and issues. Due to company's
policy I can't proper details but the code would help out others going through the process of text mining and creating
a wordcloud using that text.

The data was too messy, containing :
1. Special characters, 
2. Emoticons(emojis), 
3. Sentences in foreign languages,
4. Hashtags,
5. Null fields,
6. Unnecessary tabs and spaces.
