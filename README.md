# Word-Cloud-for-Bag-of-Words-Model
This project is purely based on NLP and performing text mining using that to create a Bag of words model in order to create a word cloud from it to get certain insights from the data. Due to company's privacy policy, I couldn't share the data files which I used to create this project.

This was one of my very first projects of my intern as a Data Scientist at Strategic IP Information, Noida.
I can't share the dataset and other files which were used in this prject to perform text mining over, and creating a
wordcloud after text analysis due to company's privacy policy. This wordcloud indicates the very words which were used most frequently and then using those words, certain entities were extracted out of the data, indicating certain related online risks and issues. Due to company's policy I can't proper details but the code would help out others going through the process of text mining and creating
a wordcloud using that text.

The data was too messy, containing :
1. Special characters, 
2. Emoticons(emojis), 
3. Sentences in foreign languages,
4. Hashtags,
5. Null fields,
6. Numeric values,
7. Unnecessary tabs and spaces.
